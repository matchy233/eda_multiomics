# ðŸ”­ Explorative analysis using laggedcor package for Multiomics Data

## Goal

1. Tune the parameters of the _developed_ methods and functions in R package laggedcor
2. Perform data analysis using `laggedcor`, and save the analysis code for future reproduction
3. (Probably) Perform machine learning task for the multiomics data, save the training code (as `laggedcor` package likely only needs the model instead of the whole traning process, but we'll see)

## What the repo likely contains

1. Notebooks for interactive data analysis, R markdown or Jupyter notebook
2. Training code for models used in `laggedcor`
